        <p>Computers can do many things, but they can’t see a painting the way that a person can. Does that mean that a computer cannot tell art apart? Nope! Computers can help people solve complex problems using something called machine learning. One type of problem computers can solve using machine learning is a classification problem. In this case, the classification problem is deciding whether a painting was made by Vincent van Gogh or by someone else. 
        </p>
        <p>So how can a computer classify art if it can’t see the art? All machine learning requires data and for this problem, the data is pictures. When computers use machine learning, they need the data to be in the form of numbers. Before we can get started teaching the computer how to classify our images, we have to turn the pictures into numbers! Digital images - images on computers - are made of pixels, which are like little dots. We can have the computer give each pixel of a picture a number value and put the numbers in one long list. Think of it like unraveling a sweater into one long piece of yarn, but the yarn is made of numbers. There are a few other things that have to happen for our pictures to be ready to use but we won’t worry about those right now - turning the pictures into numbers is the most important one!
        </p>
        <p>Once the data is ready, we need a machine learning model that can take that data and help us solve our problem. There are many types of machine learning models but for this problem we are going to use one called a neural network. Neural networks get their name from neurons, cells found in your brain, because the people who had the idea to create neural networks were inspired by neurons. The units in a neural network work together just like the neurons in your brain but they are arranged in layers. Each unit does one small part of the task of classifying the image using complicated math. The unit then passes its work on to all the units in the next layer for their turn.  When the data reaches the output layer - the last one - the model gives its result.  What does our model output? It tells us its best guess whether the picture was made by van Gogh or by someone else.
